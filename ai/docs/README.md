# Docs – The Last of the Snacks

This folder holds setup and feature documentation for humans and AI.

## Suggested contents

- **CURSOR_SETUP.md** – How this repo is configured for Cursor (rules, context, quick start).
- **MESSAGE_PROTOCOL.md** – WebSocket message types (client → server and server → client), payloads, and error codes.
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** – Docker Compose, nginx, Traefik, env vars for local and production.

Add new docs here when you introduce new protocols, APIs, or deployment steps. Reference them from `ai/README.md` and from `.cursorrules` or `CURSOR.md` when relevant.
